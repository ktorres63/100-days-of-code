# JS exercises

## Ex 1

Write the function camelize(str) that changes dash-separated words like “my-short-string” into camel-cased “myShortString”.
That is: removes all dashes, each word after dash becomes uppercased.
P.S. Hint: use split to split the string into an array, transform it and join back.

## Ex 2
Write a function filterRange(arr, a, b) that gets an array arr, looks for elements with values higher or equal to a and lower or equal to b and return a result as an array.

The function should not modify the array. It should return the new array.
## Ex 3
Write a function filterRangeInPlace(arr, a, b) that gets an array arr and removes from it all values except those that are between a and b. The test is: a ≤ arr[i] ≤ b.
The function should only modify the array. It should not return anything.
