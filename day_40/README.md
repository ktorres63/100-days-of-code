## Sort in decreasing order 
## Copy and sort array
We have an array of strings arr. Weâ€™d like to have a sorted copy of it, but keep arr unmodified.

Create a function copySorted(arr) that returns such a copy.
## Map to names
You have an array of user objects, each one has user.name. Write the code that converts it into an array of names.
## Map to objects
You have an array of user objects, each one has name, surname and id.
Write the code to create another array from it, of objects with id and fullName, where fullName is generated from name and surname.
## Sort users by age
Write the function sortByAge(users) that gets an array of objects with the age property and sorts them by age.
## Shuffle an array
Write the function shuffle(array) that shuffles (randomly reorders) elements of the array.
Multiple runs of shuffle may lead to different orders of elements

Write the function getAverageAge(users) that gets an array of objects with property age and returns the average age.

The formula for the average is (age1 + age2 + ... + ageN) / N.
