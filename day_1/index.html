        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li> Roll out the pie crust and place it in a 9-inch pie dish. Crimp the edges of the crust as desired, and
                then prick the bottom and sides with a fork to prevent air bubbles from forming during baking. Bake the
                crust according to package instructions or until golden brown. Allow it to cool completely before adding
                the filling.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together 1 1/4 cups sugar, cornstarch, and salt.</li>
            <li> Gradually whisk in the water until smooth, then add the egg yolks, lemon zest, and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and comes to a boil. This usually
                takes about 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li> Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the butter until melted and well combined.
            <li>Pour the lemon filling into the cooled pie crust.</li>
            <li>In a clean, dry mixing bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar on high speed until soft peaks
                form.</li>
            <li> Gradually add 1/2 cup of sugar, a tablespoon at a time, while continuing to beat until stiff peaks form
                and the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Spread the meringue over the hot lemon filling, making sure to spread it all the way to the edges of the
                crust to seal in the filling.</li>
            <li>Use the back of a spoon to create decorative peaks in the meringue.</li>
            <li>Bake the pie in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the meringue is lightly golden brown.</li>
            <li>Allow the pie to cool completely at room temperature for at least 2 hours before slicing and serving.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, slice the pie into wedges and serve. Enjoy!</li>
